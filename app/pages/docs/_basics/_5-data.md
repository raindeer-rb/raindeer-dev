There are two main ways to query the database; traditional SQL queries and Data Expressions.

## SQL

Raindeer uses the repository pattern and the Sequel gem.

## Data Expressions [UNRELEASED]

Instead of the model defining relationships and associated queries to the database, LowData follows the repository pattern with a twist; Data Expressions.

This expression joins the `posts` table with the `users` table while representing a join conceptually as simple arithmetic:

```ruby
class PostsData < LowData
  def all
    Users[:username] + Posts[:title, :body]
  end
end
```

The above expression generates SQL to join the user table with the posts table and results in a list of posts with the user's username included in each row.

## Data Inversion

Data Expressions can invert the usual database query logic; instead of building a query of what we want from the database, we build the table we want and let the expression build the query.

```ruby
class PostsData < LowData
  def all
    Table[:username, :title, :body]
  end
end
```

This expression generates equivalent SQL to the `Users + Posts` example above. It's smart enough to know that we're in a `Posts` repository, and that our `Posts` table has a foreign key of `user_id` to the `Users` table. LowData then connects `:username` to this table automatically.
